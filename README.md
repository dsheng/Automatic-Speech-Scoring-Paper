* [Impact of ASR Performance on Free Speaking Language Assessment](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~ar527/knill_is2018.pdf), K.M.Knill, *Interspeech 2018* :star::star::star:

This paper considered the impact of ASR performance on assessment of free speaking tests of non-native learners of English. Comparison of 2 state-of-the-art ASR systems with a significant difference in WER showed that the baseline auto-marking system based on audio and fluency related features was unaffected by the reduction in WER due to the system having been designed to mitigate ASR errors.
