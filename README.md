* [Impact of ASR Performance on Free Speaking Language Assessment](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~ar527/knill_is2018.pdf), K.M.Knill, *Interspeech 2018* :star::star::star:

This paper considered the impact of ASR performance on assessment of free speaking tests of non-native learners of English. Comparison of 2 state-of-the-art ASR systems with a significant difference in WER showed that the baseline auto-marking system based on audio and fluency related features was unaffected by the reduction in WER due to the system having been designed to mitigate ASR errors. The impact that ASR errors may have on the ability of the system to provide detailed feedback to the learner was also analysed.
